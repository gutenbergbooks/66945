<p>This Memoir of the Services of the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment,
now 1st Battalion Royal Irish Rifles, was originally arranged and
prepared for publication, from September, 1793, “in which year the
Regiment was raised,” to September, 1863, by Brevet Major Edward
William Bray, who was then serving with the Regiment. The later
history, from 1864 up to present time, has been collected from the
Authentic Records preserved in the Regimental Orderly Room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793.</div>

<p class="drop-cap p-left">In September, 1793, Major William Fitch obtained a letter of service
to raise a regiment, which, after being numbered, became the 83rd, its
formation bearing date 28th September, 1793, and of which the major was
appointed lieutenant-colonel commandant. The regiment was embodied at
Dublin, and quartered in the old Custom House at Essex Bridge for about
two months, when it was called upon to take a portion of the garrison
duties, in consequence of a great number of troops having been drawn
from that garrison for the purpose of embarking for the West Indies.
The regiment then moved to the royal barracks. The establishment of the
regiment at this period was fixed at 72 sergeants, 26 drummers, 1200
rank and file, and an additional lieutenant added to each company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794.</div>

<p>In October, 1794, a second battalion was added to the regiment, and the
establishment of the first battalion was reduced to 52 sergeants, 22
drummers, and 1000 rank and file. The 2nd Battalion soon afterwards was
numbered, and became the 134th Regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<p>On the 7th November, 1794, the regiment embarked at Dublin and sailed
for England. It landed at Pill and marched to Bath, in Somersetshire,
where it was quartered several months. It then marched to Poole, in
Dorsetshire, where it remained about five months, and from thence to
Southampton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795.</div>

<p>On the 5th May, 1795, the regiment embarked at Stokes Bay for the West
Indies, and sailed in about ten days afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>On the arrival of the regiment at Martinique, it received orders to
proceed to Jamaica, and, after a few days’ sail, arrived at Port Royal
on the 16th July, 1795.</p>

<p>The regiment was then removed from the chartered ships to men-of-war
and transports, and sailed for Saint Domingo; but the Maroon
insurrection having broken out a few days after the regiment had
sailed, Lord Balcarras, the Governor, despatched a schooner to recall
them; but she could only overtake two ships, which returned with about
half the regiment, which landed at Mondego Bay and was marched into the
interior.</p>

<p>The regiment was actively employed in the suppression of the Maroon
insurrection for about eight months, and sustained a loss of 70 killed
and wounded; amongst the former was the Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant,
William Fitch; and Captains Lee and Brunt slightly wounded&mdash;the former
died in four days afterwards.</p>

<p>On the 13th September, 1795, Major-General James Balfour succeeded to
the colonelcy, vice Lieutenant-Colonel Fitch, killed in action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1798.</div>

<p>The few men that remained of the detachment that went to Saint Domingo
in 1795 returned to Jamaica in 1798.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802.</div>

<p>The regiment remained on the north side of Jamaica until the beginning
of June, 1802, when it embarked in men-of-war at Savannah le Mar,
Falmouth, and Mondego Bay, for Port Royal, and on its arrival marched
to Spanish Town; shortly afterwards the men were allowed to extend
their services in the 60th and 85th, and a few to the 2nd West India
Regiment.</p>

<p>On the 4th July, 1802, the regiment embarked on board His Majesty’s
ship <i>Delft</i>, and landed at Portsmouth on the 22nd August
following, its strength being 1 lieutenant-colonel, 2 majors, 9
captains, 16 subalterns, 29 sergeants, 11 drummers, and 294 rank and
file.</p>

<p>During the service of seven years of the regiment in the West Indies,
it received drafts and volunteers from several regiments, amounting to
410 rank and file, and deducting men who were drafted and volunteered
on its embarkation from England, the regiment appears to have lost by
deaths 870 non-commissioned officers and rank and file, from the period
of its arrival in the West Indies to its return to England in August,
1802.</p>

<p>During this period the officers named in the margin also died.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>The regiment on disembarking proceeded to Hilsea Barracks, where it
remained about three weeks, from whence it proceeded to Chelmsford; and
in March, 1803, received the route for Portsmouth, and on its arrival
embarked for Jersey, on board the <i>Acastra</i> frigate and other
vessels; and on its disembarkation was quartered at Grove Hill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806.</div>

<p>On the 4th May, 1805, the regiment embarked at St. Heliers. It joined
the expedition at the Cove of Cork, destined against the Cape of
Good Hope, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir David Baird,
and landed at the Cape on the 6th January, 1806; and was actually
employed in the reduction of that settlement, where its head-quarters
were stationed, and where it remained quartered until October, 1817,
when it was joined by a large detachment of the 2nd Battalion, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Collier, on the reduction of the 2nd Battalion at
Armagh in 1817. The whole of the regiment, now reunited, and forming
but one battalion henceforward, was collected together at Simon’s Bay,
Cape of Good Hope, in September, 1817, and embarked for Ceylon on 1st
October, 1817.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h2>PART II<br />
<span class="subhed">HISTORY OF THE <span class="sm">2ND</span> BATTALION, 1804&ndash;14, AND SERVICES OF THE
REGIMENT DURING THE PENINSULAR WAR</span></h2></div>

<p class="drop-cap p-left">The 2nd Battalion, 83rd Regiment, was raised in the year 1804; the
establishment being fixed at 600 rank and file, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Hutchison, who had previously belonged to the 1st
Battalion.</p>

<p>The head-quarters of the 2nd Battalion were first established at
Horsham Barracks, Sussex, where it remained a few months and was then
removed to Chichester, at which place it received a draft of 300 men,
chiefly from the 3rd Royal Lancashire Militia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805.</div>

<p>During the stay of the battalion at Chichester, Lieutenant-Colonel
Hutchison was removed to the Staff, and Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon
succeeded to the command of the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806.</div>

<p>The battalion removed to Newport, in the Isle of Wight, whence it sent
270 rank and file, with a proportion of officers and non-commissioned
officers (being the entire of the effectives fit for active service),
to join the 1st Battalion at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>In August the battalion marched to Chipping Norton, in Oxfordshire, and
in November following removed to Battle Barracks, Sussex, where its
establishment was increased to 800 rank and file. After a short stay at
this station, it was ordered to Brabourne Leas and Ashford, in Kent,
and in March, 1807, proceeded to Portsmouth and embarked for Guernsey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1807.</div>

<p>Having remained a few days there, it re-embarked and sailed for Jersey;
and was quartered at St. Owens, in that island.</p>

<p>In September following it embarked for Ireland; but owing to contrary
winds, the whole battalion was not assembled at Cove till January,
1808, when it marched to Kinsale, County Cork.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>

<p>The same month the battalion was marched to Birr, in King’s County,
where its establishment was augmented to 1000 rank and file, and an
additional lieutenant appointed to each company; from this place 14
officers and 214 rank and file were sent to reinforce the 1st Battalion
at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>In the month of May following the battalion marched to Dublin and
occupied the Palatine Barracks, and in December marched to Fermoy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>

<p>In January, 1809, the battalion marched from Fermoy to Cork, and
embarked at Cove for Corunna; but intelligence having been received of
the battle of Corunna and the evacuation of Spain by the British, a
ship of war was despatched to recall the transports, when the regiment
disembarked and marched back to its old quarters at Fermoy.</p>

<p>In March following the battalion received orders to march to Cove,
for embarkation for Lisbon, and having been previously inspected by
Brigadier-General Rowland Hill, proceeded to Cove, and embarking on
board the transports, sailed to join the British army in Portugal.</p>

<p>On the 6th April, 1809, the battalion, 900 strong, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon, landed at Lisbon, and was immediately
despatched to join the British army, then under the command of Sir John
Cradock, at Coimbra. It was there brigaded with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> the 9th Regiment (1st
Battalion), and placed under the command of Brigadier-General Alan
Cameron.</p>


<h3>CAMPAIGN OF THE DOURO</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>

<p>General Sir Arthur Wellesley, having superseded Sir John Cradock in the
command of the army, advanced to the relief of Oporto, then occupied by
the French. General Cameron’s brigade was placed in General Sherbrook’s
division, and was actively engaged at the passage of the Douro and the
attack on the French in Oporto.</p>

<p>On the 12th May, at the passage of the Douro, Captain Summerfield and
the Light Company of the 83rd were amongst the foremost that crossed in
the boats, and occupied the Seminary, and Captain Summerfield rendered
himself conspicuous by his gallantry in climbing up and endeavouring
to secure the iron gate of the building. The remainder of the regiment
crossed at Villa Nova, and, having fought their way through the streets
of Oporto, came upon the rear of the enemy as, with their artillery,
they were moving out of the town.</p>

<p>At this moment the French were exposed to a flank fire from the troops
which had occupied the Seminary, the 83rd and 9th at the same time
pouring a volley into their rear. The greater part were killed and
wounded, and the remainder dispersing, left their guns in possession of
the victorious British.</p>

<p>In this affair the battalion had 14 men wounded.</p>

<p>The 2nd Battalion, 83rd, was one of the regiments employed in the
pursuit of the French army to the frontiers of Spain; and on the 16th,
a little after dark, after a harassing and stormy march, overtook the
French rear-guard at Salamonde. The 9th and 83rd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> immediately attacked,
and the French, the greater part of whom were cooking, and quite
unprepared, were speedily driven from the position.</p>

<p>The battalion in this affair had 5 men wounded. The pursuit was
continued on the 18th to Montalagne; but the whole army subsequently
retiring to Abrantes, the 9th and 83rd went into quarters at Tancos, on
the banks of the Tagus, about eight leagues from the former place. Here
sickness prevailed to such an extent in the whole army, and especially
in the 9th regiment, that that corps was obliged to be sent to Lisbon,
and its place in General Cameron’s brigade was taken by the 61st
Regiment, at Oropesa, on the subsequent advance of the army to Talavera.</p>


<h3>CAMPAIGN AND BATTLE OF TALAVERA</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>

<p>In all the movements and privations of the British army in this advance
the 83rd bore its full share; and on the 27th and 28th July, when
under Sir Arthur Wellesley, it fought and won the glorious battle of
Talavera. The battalion was most severely engaged, and particularly
distinguished itself in the gallant and impetuous charge on the enemy’s
line, made by General Sherbrook’s division with the bayonet.</p>

<p>In this battle, General Alan Cameron’s brigade, composed of the 61st
and 83rd Regiments, was posted in the left centre of the front line,
with the brigade of Guards on its right, and the German Legion on its
left, and about 100 paces in its front, occupied by its Light Infantry,
was the dry, rocky bed of a mountain torrent. On the 27th, the French
attempted to turn the allies’ left, and to take a height in front
of General Hill’s division. In this they were unsuccessful, but the
following day, at about 2 p.m., they renewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> their efforts, and made a
general attack on the whole line.</p>

<p>The battle then recommenced, and raged with redoubled fury. The French
guns played with murderous precision on General Cameron’s brigade, and
the men of the 61st and 83rd Regiments were mowed down by sections.</p>

<p>Under cover of this fire, the French Infantry, in imposing masses,
advanced rapidly and steadily to the attack.</p>

<p>The 83rd Regiment had been previously ordered to lie down to avoid the
tremendous cannonade directed against it; but on the French battalion
nearing the ravine on its front, it rose up, and with the 61st
advancing steadily to meet them, allowed their dark columns to approach
to within thirty paces of their ranks, then, pouring in a well-directed
and destructive volley, it dashed impetuously forward through the
ravine, and, charging vigorously with the bayonet, drove the enemy with
great slaughter headlong before them.</p>

<p>The regiment followed in pursuit, until it received the command to
retire, when, facing about and carrying off its wounded, it steadily
recrossed the ravine, and, amid the warm encomiums of General Cameron
himself, resumed its original position in the line; this (together with
the 61st) it maintained with unflinching resolution till the close of
the day, when the French (who had been temporarily successful on the
right and left of the brigade) were compelled to return, leaving the
victory to the British.</p>

<p>The very severe loss of the 83rd in this hard-fought battle, amounting
to nearly half its number present, fully testifies the honourable
service it performed.</p>

<p>Its commanding officer, Colonel Gordon, while cheering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> and leading on
his men, fell in the first burst of the glorious charge at their head.</p>

<p>Three lieutenants&mdash;Montgomery, Dahman, and Flood&mdash;with 2 sergeants and
64 rank and file, were killed with him. Two captains&mdash;Summerfield and
Reynolds; 7 lieutenants&mdash;Abel, Johnstone, Nicholson, Pine, Boggie,
Baldwin, and Ferris; 4 ensigns&mdash;Lord Tulloch, Barry, Carey, and Irwin;
and Adjutant Brahan, with 15 sergeants, 2 drummers, and 265 rank and
file, were wounded; making the total casualties of the battalion 365
rank and file killed and wounded, and amongst the latter many were so
badly injured that on the subsequent abandonment of Talavera by the
Spaniards, the greater part, being unable to move, fell into the hands
of the French.</p>

<p>For the services of the regiment in this arduous battle, Sir William
Gordon, the brother of Colonel Gordon, received the medal which would
have decorated that gallant soldier’s breast, had he happily survived
the action.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pine, the subaltern of the Grenadier Company of the 83rd,
was promoted to a company in the 66th Regiment for his distinguished
valour in hastening to the assistance of the colours&mdash;in carrying
which through this battle, officer after officer had been shot down.
Lieutenant Pine seized one of the colours and bore it gallantly
forward, and did not relinquish it till he was himself severely wounded
and obliged to be relieved of his honourable burden. Many sergeants
also were killed and wounded in protecting the colours through this
fierce battle.</p>

<p>Its casualties, however, had so weakened the 83rd, that it was deemed
unable to keep the field any longer; it was on this account ordered to
Lisbon, and on its departure from the army General Cameron expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
his approbation of the corps, and his appreciation of its conduct in
the battle of Talavera, in the following brigade order:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center p-left">“BRIGADE ORDERS</p>

<p class="r2 narrow">“<span class="smcap">Talavera de la Real</span>, <i>August 29th, 1809</i>.</p>

<p>“The death of Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon, who so gloriously fell
at the head of the 2nd Battalion 83rd Regiment, while charging
the enemy on the 28th ult., leaves Brigadier-General Cameron the
painful necessity of regretting the loss of a sincere friend and
gallant officer, and his regiment that of a brave and worthy
commander.</p>

<p>“The conduct of the 83rd Regiment in the arduous contest of
Talavera merits the Brigadier-General’s warmest thanks, and he
hopes that Major Napper will justly appreciate the merits of
those few that are left.</p>

<p>“The very weak state of the 83rd renders it necessary to send
them to Lisbon. The Brigadier-General requests them to accept of
his best acknowledgments for their uniform good conduct whilst
under his command, and has, at the same time, to assure them
that he shall be proud to have the 83rd again in his brigade,
when established in health and numbers.</p>

<p class="r2 narrow">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">H. Balneavis</span>, Captain,</p>

<p class="r1 narrow">“Acting Brigade Major.”</p></div>


<p>In addition to the above honourable testimonial to its services in
this action, the 83rd has been graciously permitted to have the word
“Talavera” inscribed on its colours and appointments, in commemoration
of its distinguished gallantry in that battle.</p>

<p>The battalion arrived in Lisbon in October, 1809, and remained
there till the beginning of September, 1810, during which period
Lieutenant-Colonel Collins joined from the 1st Battalion and assumed
the command.</p>

<p>In the beginning of September, 1810, the battalion being re-established
in health, and numbering 600 rank and file, marched under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Collins, to join Lord Wellington, at that time
retiring to the frontiers of Portugal. It effected its junction with
the army the same month, and was placed in the left brigade of the 3rd
Division, commanded by General Picton, and in the celebrated division
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> acquired in the army the distinguished appellation of the
“Fighting Division” the 83rd had the honour of serving throughout the
remainder of the Peninsular campaigns.</p>

<p>With it, therefore, and its heroic commander, Sir Thomas Picton,
the services of the battalion in this memorable war are henceforth
identified, being engaged in every skirmish, battle, and assault which
this renowned division fought and won, and in every glorious deed of
daring and honour it was ever so nobly performing.</p>

<p>On the 26th and 27th of September the battalion was engaged in the
actions on the Sierra de Busaco; but the brunt of the battle falling
to the good fortune of the right brigade, its casualties were few,
amounting only to 1 lieutenant (Lieutenant Colthurst) and 6 rank and
file wounded. For the services of the regiment on this occasion Colonel
Collins received a medal, and his Majesty was pleased to sanction the
word “Busaco” being borne on its colours and appointments.</p>

<p>Shortly after Lieutenant-Colonel Collins was removed to the command
of a brigade in the Portuguese service, and the command of the 83rd
devolved upon Major H. W. Carr.</p>

<p>After the decisive and signal repulse of the French at Busaco, the
British army continued its retrograde movement until it was halted by
its skilful commander in the strongly fortified lines of Torres Vedras,
and the regiment remained in position in these celebrated lines till
the month of March, 1811, when the French, under Marshal Massena,
commenced its retreat.</p>

<p>The British army followed in eager and hot pursuit, and the 3rd
Division hanging closely on the rear, the 83rd was in constant and warm
engagement with the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>It came up with them at Leyria, Pombal, and Condeixa, and in the
skirmishes at those places, and at Fleur-de-Lis, Guarda, and Sabugal,
its casualties amounted to 2 sergeants and 52 men killed and wounded.</p>

<p>In May following, the battalion was actively engaged in the actions
at Fuentes d’Onor, on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of that month, and was
mentioned in Lord Wellington’s despatch of the battle, as being
distinguished in the defence of the village of Fuentes d’Onor, and
the repulse of the enemy therefrom. Its casualties, however, were
fortunately but few, amounting to 1 lieutenant (Ferris) and 6 rank and
file killed, and 1 lieutenant (Vereker), 1 sergeant, and 22 rank and
file wounded, and his Majesty was pleased to sanction the word “Fuentes
d’Onor” being inscribed on the colours and appointments of the 83rd,
in commemoration of the distinguished conduct of the battalion in that
battle.</p>

<p>The same month the battalion was employed in the first siege of
Badajoz, and had 6 rank and file wounded in the trenches.</p>

<p>The siege being raised, the regiment assisted in the blockade of Ciudad
Rodrigo, and on the 25th September, when Marshal Marmont advanced to
the relief of that fortress, the 83rd, with Colville’s brigade, then
composed of the 5th (2nd Battalion), 77th, 83rd, and 94th Regiments,
greatly distinguished itself. On that occasion immense bodies of French
cavalry, supported by artillery and infantry, attacked the 5th and 77th
Regiments in their position on a hill, covering the road to Guinaldo;
but these two gallant regiments nobly sustained their assault, and
repeatedly repulsed the enemy. Their flank, however, being threatened,
Lord Wellington gave the order to retire, when, being joined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> by the
remaining regiments of the brigade, the whole, driving back the French
horsemen whenever they approached them, fell back steadily, until they
reached Guinaldo, where they were halted, and joined the day after by
the right brigade, which, stationed at Pastores, had been cut off by
the movement. In this gallant affair the 83rd had 1 sergeant and 5 rank
and file killed, and 3 sergeants and 16 rank and file wounded.</p>


<h3>CIUDAD RODRIGO</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1812.</div>

<p>In the month of January, 1812, the regiment was employed in the siege
and capture of Ciudad Rodrigo; and on the 19th of that month, when that
fortress was taken by storm, the Light Company of the 83rd, under the
Hon. Captain Powys, led the right attack, and escaladed the outwork in
front of the castle. The remainder of the battalion lined the trenches
and covered the advance of the storming parties of the 3rd Division
in their assault on the great breach. The loss of the regiment in
the siege amounted to 4 men killed, and 2 lieutenants (Vereker and
Matthews) and 12 men wounded; and the word “Ciudad Rodrigo” has been
inscribed by the royal authority on its colours and appointments for
its services on this occasion.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>


<h3>BADAJOZ</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1812.</div>

<p>At Badajoz, in April, the same year, the regiments of the 3rd Division
were again called upon to display the burning, irresistible courage of
British soldiers, and the capture of that fortress by storm on the 6th
April was mainly attributed to the impetuous valour with which they
escaladed and took the castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>On this, as on former occasions, the 83rd highly distinguished itself,
and its services on the 25th March were most conspicuous.</p>

<p>On the 25th March, fire was first opened on Badajoz, and it was
determined to storm the outwork, La Picurina, after nightfall on
that day. For this purpose, General Kempt, with 500 men from the 3rd
Division, was ordered to carry it by assault. These he divided into
three divisions, the centre of which, composed of 100 men from the
83rd, under the Hon. Captain Powys, was held in reserve. The flank
divisions rushed impetuously to the attack, but the strength of the
work, and the destructive musketry of the French, having rendered their
courageous efforts fruitless, Powys and his reserve were also sent
headlong against it. Running vehemently forward, the men of the 83rd
soon cleared the intervening space, and in spite of a most galling fire
escaladed the work, at a salient angle, and mounted the rampart. Here a
desperate struggle ensued. Powys, first and foremost of his men, fell
dangerously wounded, but Sergeant Hazlust of his regiment, defending
him stoutly with his halberd, kept the French at bay, and held his
ground till the remainder of the men, clambering up thickly and
resolutely, came to his aid, and driving the enemy before them, cleared
the ramparts, and enabled the flank divisions to enter also. For this
gallant service, Captain Powys received the rank of brevet major, but
did not survive to enjoy the fruits of his bravery. With his dying
breath, however, the gallant fellow recommended Sergeant Hazlust to the
notice of his superiors, and that valiant soldier, for his conduct on
this occasion, was almost immediately promoted to be sergeant-major of
the battalion.</p>

<p>On the 6th April, also, the memorable night of the storm of Badajoz,
the 83rd most successfully and nobly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> availed itself of the glorious
opportunity of distinction afforded it. The distinguished honour of
leading the 3rd Division in the assault on the castle was assigned
to it, and, rapidly and resolutely filing over the narrow bridge of
the little River Rivillas, the regiment rushed impetuously to the
walls, and under a most galling and murderous discharge of shells and
combustibles, planted the ladders against them. Four out of the seven
ladders were broken and destroyed, but officers and men, mounting the
remainder, made the most determined efforts to force themselves in,
repeatedly driven back and thrown down, crushed and bruised, from the
parapets of the ramparts. The 83rd still persevered, and at length
Major Carr, Captain Hext, Lieutenant Broomfield, Adjutant Swinburne,
with others, followed closely by their men, effected an entrance at the
right angle of the work, and established themselves on the rampart. At
about the same time, the remainder of the division scaling the wall
at another angle, the French turned and made in full flight for the
gate. The officers and men of the 83rd rapidly pursued, and closing
the gate, and blocking it with stones, wood, and other materials,
secured the castle from recapture by the French, who, crowding from the
breaches, and pouring volley after volley through it, endeavoured in
vain to retake it. The castle thus being won, the French abandoned the
remaining defences, and surrendered the fortress to the British.</p>

<p>The regiment’s loss in this siege and assault was necessarily
very severe, amounting to one-third of its number engaged. Three
officers&mdash;Captains Powys, Fry, and Ensign Hackett&mdash;with 1 sergeant,
and 36 rank and file, were killed; and 6 officers&mdash;Lieutenants
Broomfield, O’Neill, Bowles, Lane, Vavasour, and Baldwin&mdash;and 81
rank and file, wounded. Major Carr received a clasp and the rank of
lieutenant-colonel, and Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> Hext that of brevet major, for their
own and their regiment’s highly distinguished conduct in this assault,
and his Majesty has been pleased to permit the 83rd to bear the word
“Badajoz” on its colours and appointments, in commemoration of the
important and successful service it there rendered.</p>


<h3>CAMPAIGN OF SALAMANCA</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1812.</div>

<p>The fall of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz having opened the way into
Spain, the British army was enabled to commence its march into that
country, and the 2nd Battalion 83rd, serving throughout the glorious
campaign of 1812, had its full share of danger and honour, in the
memorable victory of Salamanca, when the French army, under Marshal
Marmont, was signally defeated on the 22nd July, 1812.</p>

<p>On that glorious day, the 3rd Division, commanded by Major-General
the Hon. Edward Pakenham (General Picton being absent on account of
ill-health) was posted in a wood, behind Aldea Tejada, completely
concealed from the enemy, and securing the main road to Ciudad Rodrigo.
About 2 p.m., the French, endeavouring to turn the British right and
gain the road to Ciudad Rodrigo, extended their left in the direction
of that fortress, thereby weakening their centre, and affording Lord
Wellington the favourable opportunity he had so long desired of
attacking them. He immediately took advantage of it, and assailing
in front, with the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Divisions, ordered the 3rd
Division to attack the French columns, which were moving down on the
Ciudad Rodrigo road, and nobly and gallantly did General Pakenham
launch the battalions of the “Fighting Division” against the enemy;
forming line by regiments, they rushed impetuously forward, and bearing
on with resistless force, carried everything before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<p>The 83rd Regiment, with Colville’s brigade, was in the full brunt of
this decisive and successful attack. At one time charging gallantly
forward, it overthrew the enemy whenever he stood to meet it; at
another, halting, and wheeling by divisions, to allow the British
cavalry to pass through, it re-formed, and followed hotly on,
encouraging and cheering the pursuing troopers.</p>

<p>Three thousand prisoners were taken by the division this day, and
special mention of its commander and it was made by Lord Wellington in
his despatch. Colonel Campbell, also, who commanded Colville’s brigade
(in the absence of that officer commanding the 4th Division), received
his lordship’s thanks for its services on the occasion.</p>

<p>The casualties of the battalion in this battle amounted to 13 rank
and file killed, and 1 lieutenant (Lieutenant Gascoyne) and 32 rank
and file wounded; and it had, moreover, the great misfortune to
lose, though not in its own ranks, its gallant lieutenant-colonel
(Lieutenant-Colonel Collins), who, commanding a Portuguese brigade, had
previously, at the sanguinary battle of Albuera, lost a leg, and now,
in this great action again distinguishing himself, received a mortal
wound.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Carr had one horse, and Adjutant Swinburne two
horses, shot under them, and in commemoration of the distinguished
services of the battalion of the 83rd in this action, his Majesty
has been graciously pleased to sanction the word “Salamanca” being
inscribed on its colours and appointments.</p>

<p>The battalion was next employed in the investment of the “Retiro,” a
fortified building at Madrid; at which two men of the battalion were
wounded. It subsequently retired with the 3rd Division, when the whole
of the army retreated from before Burgos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>


<h3>CAMPAIGN OF VITTORIA</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1813.</div>

<p>The next service which the battalion had the good fortune to be engaged
in was the triumphant battle of Vittoria, on the 21st June, 1813, when
the 83rd bore a prominent part and highly distinguished itself. On that
occasion, Colville’s brigade being in front, the 83rd had the honour of
leading the 3rd Division in its passage across the River Zadara; and
the advance of the brigade against the enemy drew forth the especial
approbation of Lord Wellington, who mentioned it in his despatch in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Major-General the Hon. C. Colville’s brigade, of the 3rd Division, was
seriously attacked in its advance by a very superior force, which it
drove in, supported by General Inglis’s brigade of the 7th Division,
under Colonel Grant, of the 82nd; these officers and the troops under
their command distinguished themselves.”</p>

<p>Maxwell, an historian of the great duke’s life, also, in his
description of this memorable victory, thus vividly recounts the
advance of Colville’s brigade:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The subsequent advance of the allied columns against the enemy’s right
centre was beautifully executed, as in echelon of regiments it crossed
the hallowed ground on which tradition placed the chivalry of England
when the Black Prince delivered battle to Henry the Bastard, and by
a decisive victory replaced Don Pedro on the throne. As if animated
by some glorious impulse, the battalions advanced not to combat,
but to conquer; Colville’s brigade of the ‘Fighting Third’ led the
attack, and the first enemy’s corps that confronted it was gallantly
defeated. Pressing on with characteristic impetuosity, and without
halting to correct the irregularity a recent and successful struggle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
had occasioned, the brigade encountered on the brow of the hill two
lines of French infantry, regularly drawn up, and prepared to receive
the assailants. For a moment the result was regarded with considerable
apprehension, and means were adopted by Lord Wellington for sustaining
the brigade, when (as that event seemed inevitable) it should be
repulsed by the enemy; but valour overcame every disadvantage,
and the perfect formation of the French could not withstand the
dashing onset of the assailants; their rush was irresistible. On
went the daring soldiers, sweeping before them the formidable array
which, circumstanced as they were, appeared calculated to produce
annihilation.”</p>

<p>The 83rd, moreover, had this day the good fortune to obtain particular
commendation from General Colville himself; with the 94th it attacked
and captured a battery of guns, and in an assault on a village, led by
General Colville in person, the men of the 83rd rendered themselves so
conspicuous by their daring valour, that he directed Adjutant Swinburne
(who, with Lieutenants Hingston, Barry, C. O’Neill, and Volunteer
Nugent, were also distinguishing themselves at that particular point)
to take the names of a large number of them, to whom, after the action,
he awarded a guinea apiece.</p>

<p>The casualties of the 83rd in this glorious victory were severe:
3 officers (Major Widrington, Lieutenants Lindsey and Bloxham), 4
sergeants, and 28 rank and file were killed; and 4 officers (Captain
Venables, Lieutenants J. Smith, Baldwin, and Barry), with 6 sergeants
and 68 rank and file, were wounded. Its gallant conduct in the battle
was acknowledged by medals being awarded to its commanding officer,
Colonel Carr, and to Major Hext. Volunteer Nugent also was appointed to
an ensigncy in the battalion, and his Majesty was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> graciously pleased
to permit the word “Vittoria” being inscribed on the colours and
appointments of the 83rd, in commemoration of the distinguished service
it rendered in that battle.</p>

<p>After this crowning victory, Lord Wellington undertook the sieges of
San Sebastian and Pampeluna, and the 3rd Division was employed in the
investment of the latter place; but being shortly after relieved by the
7th Division, it was formed in right support of the remainder of the
army, which was so disposed as to cover the operations against these
strong and important fortresses.</p>

<p>On the 25th and 26th of July, the French under Marshal Soult having,
after a desperate struggle, forced the Roncesvalles and Maya Passes,
General Picton moved his division up in support, and, forming in order
of battle on the right of the 4th Division, in front of Huarte, and
extending to the hills beyond Olaz, there awaited the further advance
of the French.</p>

<p>In the ensuing hard-fought battles on the 27th and 28th July, the brunt
of the fight fell to the good fortune of the 4th Division, and the 3rd
was but slightly engaged. Its picquets and light infantry, however,
skirmished with the enemy’s tirailleurs, and the division itself
advancing on the right of the victorious 4th, turned the enemy’s left
and completed his signal repulse. In this affair the battalion lost
only 8 men wounded.</p>

<p>The French having been thus driven back, the siege of San Sebastian
was prosecuted with redoubled vigour; and at last, after a second most
sanguinary assault, the city was carried by storm. Pampeluna also
having been reduced, the British general led his victorious troops
from their lofty positions, and, descending from the snow-clad summits
of the Pyrenees, launched them on the fair and fertile provinces of
France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>On the 10th of November, 1813, 90,000 men descended to the fight,
and, rushing simultaneously from various points on the entrenched
and strongly fortified lines of the enemy, commenced the battle of
Nivelle; and here again the “Fighting Third Division” signally availed
itself of the glorious opportunity for distinction afforded it. Led by
General Charles Colville (in the absence of Picton in England), the
division attacked the left centre of the enemy’s position, and carrying
everything before it, won the bridge of Amotz, and seizing the heights
between that structure and the fortified redoubt called Louis XIV,
established itself firmly on them. It then attacked the enemy in flank,
while he was assailed in front by the 4th and 7th Divisions, stormed
the redoubt, hurled the enemy headlong out of it, and, afterwards
crossing the Nivelle, attacked him on the heights on that side of the
river also, and gained triumphant and secure possession of them.</p>

<p>In this battle, as on former occasions, the 83rd was in the heat of the
engagement, and proved itself worthy of the noble division to which it
belonged.</p>

<p>Its casualties amounted to 10 rank and file killed, and 5 officers
(Lieutenants Watson, Barry, and Wyatt, Ensigns Burgess and&mdash;&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>), and
28 rank and file wounded; and the royal authority has been received
for the regiment to bear the word “Nivelle” on its colours and
appointments, to commemorate its gallantry in that action.</p>

<p>The next service the regiment was employed in was the passage of the
Gare d’Oleron, when the 3rd Division, under General Picton himself,
attacked the ford above the bridge at Sanvetterre; the regiment, with
the left brigade commanded by Colonel Keane, was in this encounter
warmly engaged, and sustained a loss of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span> 5 rank and file killed, and 12
rank and file wounded, and lost some prisoners from the Light Infantry,
which had crossed the river.</p>

<p>At Orthes, on the 27th February, 1814, the 3rd Division was again in
the very heat and brunt of battle, and highly distinguished itself,
attacking the heights, on which the left and centre of the enemy were
strongly posted. It, after severe fighting, gained possession of them,
and with the simultaneous assaults of the 52nd Regiment on the left,
dislodged the enemy from his position and secured the victory.</p>

<p>The loss of the 83rd in this action was severe, amounting to 1
sergeant, 10 rank and file killed, 9 officers (Lieutenant-Colonel
Carr, Major Blaquiere, Captains Venables and Elliott, Lieutenants
Baldwin, Watson, and Lane, Ensign Nugent and Adjutant Swinburne), with
1 sergeant, 1 drummer, and 28 rank and file wounded; and its conduct
was so meritorious that Colonel Keane, in brigade orders, returned it
and the 87th his thanks for their gallant behaviour, declaring that
in this battle they had added to their already high reputation. On
this occasion Captain Elliott, of the Light Company, was promoted to
be brevet major, and received a medal, and his Majesty was graciously
pleased to permit the word “Orthes” to be inscribed on the colours and
appointments of the 83rd, to commemorate the service it performed in
that battle.</p>

<p>In the month of March following, Picton’s division again encountered
the enemy, and falling upon him at Vic Bigorre, drove him from his
position, and compelled him to continue his retreat.</p>

<p>In this affair the 83rd Regiment was vigorously engaged, and lost 1
sergeant and 6 men killed, and 2 Lieutenants (Hingstone and Lane) and
16 men wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>


<h3>TOULOUSE</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1814.</div>

<p>On the 10th April, the British army fought and won the crowning battle
of Toulouse, and Picton again led his division into the middle of the
fight. The 83rd Regiment, with the left brigade, was but partially
engaged and suffered a slight loss, and it has received the royal
commission to bear the word “Toulouse” on its colours and appointments,
for its services in that victory.</p>

<p>The war was at this period brought to a conclusion; the illustrious
Emperor of the French, Napoleon Bonaparte, being compelled to abdicate.
His able lieutenant, Marshal Soult, gave in his adhesion to the new
government, and hostilities accordingly ceased.</p>

<p>The 83rd was quartered at La Mao, where Major Blaquiere, having
recovered from his wounds, rejoined and assumed the command. It was
afterwards removed to Blanque Fort Camp, near Bordeaux, where 1
captain, 2 lieutenants, 1 assistant-surgeon, and 15 rank and file
joined from prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The whole army was there reviewed by the Duke of Wellington; and on the
1st of June the battalion embarked from Bordeaux for England.</p>

<p>As a reward for their own and their regiment’s service during this
memorable war, his Majesty was pleased to appoint Lieutenant-Colonel H.
W. Carr a Knight Commander, and Major George Hext a Companion, of the
Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath; and the word “Peninsula,”
inscribed by the royal authority on the colours and appointments of
the 83rd, commemorates the valiant achievements of the 2nd Battalion
throughout the whole of the Peninsular campaigns.</p>

<h2>PART III<br />
<span class="subhed">SERVICES OF THE REGIMENT IN CEYLON FROM 1814&ndash;29</span></h2></div>

<div class="sidenote">1814.</div>

<p class="drop-cap p-left">On the 4th July, 1814, the 2nd Battalion embarked on board transports
for Ireland, and on the 24th following disembarked at Monkstown, County
Cork, and marched into the Fort of Kinsale.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September the battalion marched to Clonmel, and on the
30th of October to Kilkenny, when most of the companies were detached
to do duty in the adjacent villages.</p>

<p>On the 9th of November the depôt joined from Maldon in Essex,
consisting of 1 major, 7 lieutenants, 5 ensigns, 10 sergeants, 4
drummers, and 192 rank and file, under Major Sullivan, who assumed the
command of the battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815.</div>

<p>On the 26th January, 1815, the regiment marched for Dublin, from which
place all the officers belonging to the 1st Battalion then doing duty
with the 2nd were ordered to join it at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816.</div>

<p>In the month of March, 1816, the battalion marched for Armagh, and was
detached in that and the neighbouring counties.</p>

<p>At this place Lieutenant-Colonel Cother, <span class="sm">C.B.</span>, from the
half-pay of the 71st, assumed the command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817.</div>

<p>The 2nd Battalion was inspected by Major-General Barnet on the 24th
April, 1817, and disbanded the same day, having previously selected all
the serviceable non-commissioned officers and men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> (consisting of 8
sergeants, 4 drummers, and 381 rank and file), to be held in readiness
to join the 1st Battalion, supposed to be in the island of Ceylon, for
which station it had been a considerable time under orders.</p>

<p>The major-general expressed his perfect approbation of the battalion
during its stay in Armagh, in a district order, wishing the officers
every success in future.</p>

<p>There were 15 sergeants, 7 drummers, and 164 rank and file (chiefly
wounded men) discharged in consequence of the reduction of the 2nd
Battalion.</p>

<p>The route for the march of the detachment was received on the 22nd
May, 1817, for Fermoy in two divisions, where it arrived on the
11th and 12th of June. The detachment and depôt received a further
route for Cork on the 26th June, from whence the former proceeded in
steamboats to Cove, and embarked on board the transports <i>Adamant</i>
and <i>Eliza</i>, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Cother,
<span class="sm">C.B.</span></p>

<p>The detachment sailed from the Cove on the 7th July, 1817, and arrived
in Simon’s Bay, Cape of Good Hope, on the 22nd September following,
and joined the head-quarters of the regiment, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Brunt in Simon’s Town.</p>

<p>During the services of the 1st Battalion at the Cape of Good Hope,
five companies of the regiment, under the command of Brevet Major
Summerfield, were ordered to proceed to the frontier of Africa, in
consequence of a revolt of a great number of Boers and Hottentots,
joined with the Caffres. This detachment landed at Algoa Bay, and
on its disembarkation proceeded to Graaff Reinet, on the banks of
Sunday’s River, being a march of 350 miles, through a barren country.
This revolt having been amicably settled, the detachment returned to
Algoa Bay in October,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> 1816, where it remained until September of the
following year.</p>

<p>The head-quarters, etc., embarked, and the regiment sailed from Simon’s
Bay on the 1st October, and arrived at Colombo, island of Ceylon, on
the 16th November and 3rd December, 1817.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817.</div>

<p>The insurrection in the “Kandyan”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> provinces of Ceylon having
commenced a few weeks previous to the arrival of the regiment in
that colony, nearly the whole of the battalion, then consisting of 4
field officers, 10 captains, 32 subalterns, 48 sergeants, 22 drummers,
and 969 rank and file, was marched into the interior, and was actively
employed in the suppression of the rebellion. During this service the
regiment suffered much from climate and privation of every description;
the loss in killed and wounded only amounted to 12, but the regiment
sustained a loss of 3 officers,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> 3 sergeants, 3 drummers, and 112
rank and file by disease, and previous to the effects of this campaign
being eradicated a further loss of 1 officer,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> 4 sergeants, and 86
rank and file, making a total of 209 deaths within two years after the
landing of the regiment in Ceylon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819.</div>

<p>On the 9th July, 1819, the regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Cother, was inspected by General Sir Robert Brownrigg, Bart.,

very complimentary order on the occasion.</p>

<p>The 73rd Regiment having received orders in June, 1820, to return to
England, the men of that corps were allowed to transfer their services
to other regiments in Ceylon, when 140 non-commissioned officers and
rank and file volunteered to the 83rd Regiment.</p>

<p>On the 5th September, 1821, the regiment was again inspected by

board several vessels, between the 26th March and 31st October, 1824,
and were all landed and collected at Colombo on the 6th November
following.</p>

<p>A few months previous to the regiment leaving Trincomalee, the
Governor, Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Barnes, received orders for its
return to England, but the Burmese War having broken out, the battalion
was detained, and ordered to proceed to Kandy, to relieve the 45th
Regiment, which corps had been a considerable time under orders for
India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825.</div>

remainder of the regiment, a few days afterwards.</p>

<p>During the services of the regiment in Ceylon (a period of eleven
years) it sustained a loss by deaths of 17 officers and 491
non-commissioned officers and rank and file.</p>

<p>Upon the embarkation of the regiment at Colombo, his Excellency

arrived on the 29th of the same month.</p>

<p>During the stay of the regiment at Castlebar, it furnished detachments
to Drunnore, Westport, Foxford, Ballinrobe, and Tuam.</p>

<p>The cholera having made its appearance in the corps,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> on the 26th
June, 1832, the whole of the men at head-quarters, consisting of 5
companies, and staff, were ordered into camp at Ballinew, about a
mile distant from the town, and remained encamped until the 5th of
September, when instructions were received to reoccupy the barracks.

<div class="sidenote">1836.</div>

<p>During this year the regiment remained stationary at Halifax, Nova
Scotia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837.</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Nova Scotia until the 29th June, 1837, when,
in consequence of the unsettled state of Lower Canada, orders were
received for its embarkation for Quebec on board her Majesty’s frigate
<i>Vestal</i> and <i>Champion</i> sloop of war. The head-quarters
landed on the 12th, and the remaining companies on the 13th July,
occupying the citadel barracks.</p>

<p>During the services of the regiment at Nova Scotia, a period of about
three years, it sustained a loss by deaths of 23 rank and file.</p>

<p>Upon the embarkation of the regiment, Major-General Sir Colin
Campbell, <span class="sm">K.C.B.</span>, was pleased to issue a complimentary order,
Lieutenant-Colonel Hon. H. Dundas at this time commanding.</p>

<p>On the 3rd August, 1 sergeant and 20 rank and file proceeded to Gross
Isle, and returned to the head-quarters on the 19th October. On the 1st
November, Major Trydell, with two companies, embarked for Three Rivers,
and having remained at that post about ten days, received instructions
to proceed to Montreal.</p>

<p>On the 8th December the head-quarters and remaining four companies
received orders to embark the following day for Montreal, and landed at
that station on the 11th, occupying part of the Quebec Gate barrack.</p>

<p>On the 13th December the regiment formed part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> of the brigade under
Lieutenant-General Sir J. Colbourne, <span class="sm">K.C.B.</span>, which proceeded
to attack St. Eustache, and were actively engaged in that day’s
operations.</p>

<p>The following morning the brigade proceeded to Benoit, and returned to
Montreal on the 17th December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838.</div>

<p>In January of this year, two companies proceeded on sleighs to the
Upper Provinces, and after remaining some days at St. Thomas, distant
about 600 miles from Montreal, one of them, under the command of
Lieutenant Kelsall, proceeded to Amherstburg.</p>

<p>The brigands having come over from the American shore and taken
possession of Fighting Island, this company, with one of the 32nd,
proceeded on the 25th February to disperse them, which service they
effectually performed; the brigands leaving behind them a small piece
of cannon, with ammunition, muskets, etc. On the 3rd March, this
company was again actively employed against the brigands at Peel
Island, in conjunction with a part of the 32nd Regiment, and finally
rejoined the head-quarters with the other company on the 17th June.</p>

<p>The head-quarters remained at Montreal until the 6th May, when it
proceeded viâ the St. Lawrence to Kingston.</p>

<p>On the 11th November, Lieutenant Johnson, with 44 men of the regiment
and a party of marines, embarked on board her Majesty’s steamboat
<i>Experiment</i>, with a view to cut off two American schooners, laden
with some hundreds of brigands, and whom it was reported they intended
to land in the neighbourhood of Prescott. On their arrival, it was
discovered that these marauders had effected a landing about a mile and
a half below the town, and taken possession of a large stone mill and
adjacent houses.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th, an attack on the brigands was decided on,
and Lieutenant Johnson and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> a party, with the marines under Lieutenant
Parker, reinforced by a number of volunteers, proceeded to attack
them. The men advanced under a galling fire from the walls at some
distance from the mill, and speedily expelling them from this position,
compelled them to seek refuge in the mill and houses. Lieutenant
Johnson then attempted to storm one of the houses filled with brigands,
and in the act of doing so was killed, and four rank and file wounded.
Being destitute of artillery to batter the houses, the party was
ordered to retire. In this affair the brigands sustained a loss of
about 40 killed and 28 prisoners.</p>

<p>On the 16th of this month, Colonel Dundas and four companies of the
regiment, with some heavy artillery, landed at Prescott, and at once
took up position about 500 yards from the mill. The guns were brought
to bear on the houses with great effect, and it being now late, and
daylight wearing away, the lieutenant-colonel ordered the regiment to
advance, when a smart fire was opened by the brigands from one of the
houses, and as quickly replied to. The buildings on the left of the
mill being by this time gained, were set fire to, and the enemy, seeing
no prospect of escape, threw out a “white flag,” and about 130 of them
surrendered unconditionally.</p>

<p>Their killed in this affair amounted to about 30. The only loss
sustained by the regiment on this occasion was one private killed. The
four companies returned to Kingston the day following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1839.</div>

<p>During this year the regiment remained stationary at Kingston.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840.</div>

<p>On the 19th May, 1840, the officer named in the margin<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> died at this
station, and he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> succeeded first by Lieutenant B. H. Browne, and on
his promotion Ensign William Nott was appointed adjutant. Ensign Nott
was promoted from the ranks, and performed the duties of adjutant most
efficiently for eleven years, when he became captain by seniority in
1851, at Kurrachee.</p>

<p>The regiment remained at Kingston, N. S., until the 20th and 21st May,

<p>In the <i>Mermaid</i>, under Brevet Major Ainslie.</p>

<p>In the <i>Marion</i>, under Lieutenant-Colonel Law.</p>

<p>In the <i>Ursula</i>, under Captain Lloyd.</p>

<p>In the <i>Zion’s Hope</i>, under Major Swinburne.</p>

<p>On the 8th May, 1849, the head-quarters arrived in Bombay, and on the
10th, disembarked and proceeded to Poona, and arrived at that station
on the 18th of the same month. The whole of the regiment, however, was
not assembled at Poona till the 14th July, 1849, where it remained till
November, 1850.</p>

<p>During the stay of the regiment at Poona, it lost by disease two
officers (Captain the Hon. W. Gage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> Surgeon Ledingham), 5
sergeants, 1 drummer, and 69 rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1850.</div>

<p>In November, 1850, the regiment marched in four divisions on the 2nd,
3rd, 4th, and 11th of the month for Panwell and Bombay, and embarked in

on the 14th of the same month, but the last division did not join the
regiment till the 1st December following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1851.</div>

<p>In January, 1851, Lieutenant-Colonel Trydell was appointed to the
command of the Poona brigade, and Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. Law assumed
command of the regiment.</p>

<p>From November, 1850, to 31st December, 1852, the regiment was

Ensign Graham, Quartermaster Colburn (at Poona when on leave), and

file, chiefly cases of cholera, fever, and dysentery.</p>

<p>On two occasions&mdash;viz., in May and June, 1851, and again in September
and October, 1852&mdash;the regiment was visited with cholera, fever, and
dysentery, and suffered greatly, and on the last occasion it was
considered necessary to remove the regiment from the barracks and
encamp the men on Ghizree Heights, near the sea.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1852.</div>

<p>It, however, soon recovered from these fell diseases, and numbered
upwards of 950 efficient soldiers, men strong and stalwart in form,
perfect in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> discipline, and influenced in no ordinary degree by an
ardent <i>esprit de corps</i>, the prestige of the honourable name and
high reputation won by the 83rd wherever it served.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1853.</div>

<p>On the 8th February, the right wing of the regiment (448 strength),
under the command of Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Swinburne, proceeded in
river steamers by the Indus River to Hyderabad, there to be stationed.</p>

<p>On the 15th March, 1853, the establishment of the regiment was altered
by Horse Guards’ letter, dated 24th March, 1853, to 12 captains, 20
lieutenants, 4 ensigns, and 1 adjutant.</p>

<p>Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Swinburne, after a long and
distinguished service of forty-four years in the 83rd Regiment,
retired from the service on the full pay of his rank of major. He
served throughout the whole of the Peninsular campaign (the greater
part of the time as adjutant), and received a medal and ten clasps for
Talavera, Busaco, Fuentes d’Onor, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca,
Vittoria, Nivelle, Orthes, Toulouse. He was engaged with the regiment
in the Kandyan rebellion and in Canada, and, embarking with the
regiment for India, left it on the 22nd May, 1853, with the esteem and
veneration of every individual in it.</p>

<p>He was succeeded in the majority by Captain Henry Lloyd.</p>

<p>The head-quarters, consisting of 5 subalterns, 4 staff, 19 sergeants,
6 drummers, and 353 rank and file, embarked at Kurrachee on board the
Hon. E.I.C. steam frigate <i>Semiramis</i>, for Gogo, <i>en route</i>
for Deesa; landed at Gogo on the 22nd December, where they were halted
and encamped awaiting further orders.</p>

<p>On the departure of head-quarters from Scinde, Major-General Sir Henry
Somerset, <span class="sm">K.C.B.</span>, issued a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> complimentary order to

<p>On the 23rd April, Major Henry Lloyd made over command of the
head-quarters division to Captain E. W. Bray, the senior officer, and
left Deesa for Kurrachee, there to assume command of the right wing.</p>

<p>On the 6th May, Major Henry Lloyd died at Cambay of Asiatic cholera,
while proceeding by that route to Kurrachee, to assume command of the
companies there stationed.</p>

<p>On the 14th October, the half-yearly inspection of the head-quarters

<p>On the 2nd April, the right wing, consisting of seven companies, under
the command of Captain C. W. Austen, arrived at Bombay, from Kurrachee,
and was quartered in the barracks of Colaba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>During its service in Scinde the regiment lost through disease, 5

<span class="sm">C.B.</span>, commanding northern division of the army.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 22nd December, the right wing of the regiment,
consisting of seven companies (strength&mdash;1 field officer, 2 captains,
4 subalterns, 20 sergeants, 8 drummers, 477 rank and file), under
the command of Major Kelsall, embarked at Bombay on board of the

and on the 25th commenced its march upon Deesa, viâ Surat, Baroda, and
Ahmedabad, and finally reached its destination on the 25th January,
1856, after having been separated from head-quarters for a period of
three years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1856.</div>

<p>On the 21st January, an order was received to hold a wing of the
regiment in readiness to proceed on field service.</p>

<p>On the 30th of the same month, 42 recruits, under the command of
Lieutenant Cooper, joined the regiment from England.</p>

<p>On the 27th March, the half-yearly inspection of the regiment took

<p>On 16th May, Colonel W. H. Law retired on full pay from the service,
with the rank of major-general; he served in the Peninsular War, and
was present at the battles of Nivelle and Nive, for which he received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the war medal and two clasps. Colonel Trydell being brigadier at Poona,
the command of the regiment devolved on Lieutenant-Colonel Kelsall, the
second lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p>On the 1st August, Lieutenant and Adjutant E. H. M. Mainwaring died at
Poona.</p>

<p>On the 27th October the half-yearly inspection of the regiment took
place, under Brigadier N. Wilson, <span class="sm">K.H.</span>, commanding Deesa Field

<div class="sidenote">1857.</div>

<p>On the 23rd March a detachment, in strength 3 sergeants, 4 drummers, 9
rank and file, 6 women, and 15 children, proceeded, under the command
of Lieutenant Dickenson (and in medical charge of Assistant-Surgeon
Miles), to Mount Aboo.</p>

<p>During the month of May, 1857, the regiment was held in readiness for
field service, in consequence of the mutinies of the Bengal native
army; and on the 26th of that month the left wing, composed of Nos. 5,
6, 7, and the Light Company (strength&mdash;1 field officer, 2 captains,
6 subalterns, 2 staff, 18 sergeants, 6 drummers, 250 rank and file),
under the command of Major Steele, proceeded on active service and
marched on Nusseerabad, where it arrived on the 12th June, having
performed a march of 237 miles in seventeen days during the hottest
time of the year without a single casualty.</p>

<p>On the 13th June No. 7 Company was detached from the left wing to
garrison the fort and arsenal of Ajmere.</p>

<p>The left wing was reinforced by Nos. 1, 2, 3 Companies (strength&mdash;1
captain, 2 subalterns, 7 sergeants, 3 drummers, 200 rank and file),
which left the head-quarters at Deesa on the 17th June, and arrived at
Nusseerabad on the 10th July.</p>

<p>On the 9th July two companies, under the command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> of Captain Read, were
detached from Nusseerabad to Neemuch, 143 miles distant, where they
arrived on the 18th of the same month.</p>

<p>On the 14th July the Grenadier Company, under the command of Captain
Jones, left head-quarters for Ahmedabad, the native troops in garrison
there having displayed symptoms of disaffection.</p>

<p>On the 10th August the left wing at Nusseerabad disarmed a detachment
of the 12th Regiment N. I., which had exhibited evident symptoms of
a mutinous spirit; and on the night of the 12th of the same month,
the detachment at Neemuch, under Captain S. Read, was called out to
suppress a mutiny of a squadron of the 2nd Bombay Light Cavalry; the
night was exceedingly dark, but the detachment succeeded in making
several prisoners, and sustained a loss of one man killed (Private
Chambers) and two wounded.</p>

<p>On the 21st August the detachment of the 50 invalids at Mount Aboo
was attacked by about 150 mutineers of the Joudpoor Legion, who
were repulsed with some loss in killed and wounded, without the
detachment having sustained any loss. On receipt of this intelligence
at Nusseerabad, a wing of the Joudpoor Legion, there stationed, was
disarmed by the 83rd Regiment.</p>

<p>On the 30th August a detachment of 3 officers and 119 rank and file,
under the command of Brevet Major Heatly, proceeded from Nusseerabad
for the purpose of preserving the peace of the city of Ajmere during a
Mohammedan festival. This detachment was joined on the 1st September by
a detail of 1 sergeant and 30 rank and file from the company stationed
in the fort of Ajmere. The detachment then proceeded on active service
to Beawar, where it was reinforced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> 1 captain, 2 sergeants, 1
drummer, and 50 rank and file from Nusseerabad; the detachment then,
with four guns of the Bombay Horse Artillery and some native troops,
proceeded by the mountain pass of Burr, on a reconnaissance to Awah,
which they found to be a strongly entrenched village, garrisoned
by about 3000 armed men, well provided with artillery. On the 18th
September an unsuccessful attack was made on the village, in which
three men, 83rd Regiment, were wounded, two of our four guns were
disabled, and one artilleryman was killed and two wounded, and some
casualties occurred amongst our native troops; the whole force then
returned to Ajmere, where it arrived on the 28th September.</p>

<p>On the night of the 18th September the detachment stationed at Neemuch,
under the command of Captain Read, together with two guns supported
by a detail of native troops, marched from Neemuch to take the walled
village of Nimbhera, sixteen miles distant, which was occupied by
mutineers and rebels with three guns; during the following day the
force took up a position near the village, and opened fire with the
view of effecting a breach; the fire was kept up till dark, when
further operations were suspended till next day. During the night of
the 19th the enemy, leaving their guns, ammunition, etc., hastily
evacuated the village, which was taken possession of by the force on
the morning of the 20th.</p>

<p>During the action of the 19th Assistant-Surgeon Miles was wounded in
the leg, and Lance-Corporal Thomas Young was killed.</p>

<p>On this occasion each man of the detachment received 8 rupees (16s.)
prize-money. On the night of the 20th September the force returned to
Neemuch, leaving 1 sergeant, 1 drummer, and 30 rank and file, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Ensign Chamley, to occupy the village, which detachment rejoined the
following day.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>A considerable body of the Mundisore insurgents having occupied the
fort and village of Jeerun, about ten miles from Neemuch, on the
morning of the 23rd October a detachment of 50 of the 83rd, commanded
by Captain Read, together with a company of the 12th Bombay N. I., some
native cavalry, and two guns, moved against them from Neemuch. A very
determined resistance was offered by the enemy, and Captain Read was
killed by one of their first musket shots, while leading on his small
detachment. Captain Tucker commanding the cavalry was killed, and the
officer commanding the native infantry detachment was severely wounded
about the same time. The enemy advancing in great force, the infantry
retired to a fresh position, and the enemy having suffered severely
from their fire, withdrew into the fort of Jeerun, which was occupied
and blown up on the following morning, the enemy having evacuated it in
the night. In addition to the death of Captain Read, two privates were
wounded in this affair.</p>

<p>On the 9th November the small fortified position at Neemuch, which was
garrisoned by a detachment of the 83rd Regiment, under Ensign Chamley,
and some native troops, the whole under command of Major Simpson, 2nd
Light Cavalry, was attacked by a very large insurgent force, which
invested the fortification for fifteen days; their several attempts at
assault by escalade were repulsed with heavy loss, and on the 23rd of
the month they broke up and retired on the advance of a force from Mhow
to the relief of the garrison, which had sustained a loss of about 20
in wounded during the siege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>The head-quarters of the regiment, which had remained at Deesa up to
this time, received orders to advance into Rajpootana, and marched
for Mount Aboo on the 26th October, under command of Colonel Trydell;
thence it proceeded to Nusseerabad, where it arrived on the 28th
November.</p>

<p>The detachment at Neemuch was now relieved by two companies commanded
by Major Austen.</p>

<span class="subhed">SERVICES OF THE REGIMENT, 1858&ndash;63</span></h2></div>


<div class="sidenote">1858.</div>

<p class="drop-cap p-left">An expedition was organized for the reduction of the fortress of Awah,
and two companies of the regiment having joined it, about 1000 men of
all arms, with some siege guns, arrived before Awah on the 19th January.</p>

<p>Batteries were constructed, and their fire was warmly replied to by the
enemy; an assault was arranged for the morning of the 24th January,
but, favoured by a night of intense darkness and a heavy thunderstorm,
the enemy evacuated the fortress during the night of the 23rd, about 50
of their number being killed, or taken by the picquets. Thirteen guns
were taken in the place. The defences and fortified palace were mined
and destroyed. The detachment had two men wounded.</p>

<p>Colonel Trydell and Lieutenant-Colonel Kelsall having proceeded to
England, the command of the regiment devolved on Major Steele on the
24th February, 1858.</p>

<p>On the 8th March the regiment was joined by a draft of 152 men from
England commanded by Captain Wright.</p>


<h3>SIEGE AND CAPTURE OF KOTAH</h3>

<p>The strongly fortified city of Kotah on the River Chumbul had been
for many months held by a formidable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> insurgent force. Major-General
Roberts, of the Honourable East India Company’s Army, commanding in
Rajpootana, now moved against it from Nusseerabad, with two strong
brigades; the 1st marching on the 10th March. With this brigade were
three companies of the regiment, under the command of Captain (Brevet
Lieutenant-Colonel) Heatly.</p>

<p>The 2nd Brigade, commanded by Colonel Parke, of the 72nd Highlanders,
to which the head-quarters of the regiment (strength 11 officers and
300 men) was attached, moved from Nusseerabad on the 11th March. The
whole force comprised H.M.’s 8th Hussars, a company of Royal Engineers,
the 72nd, 83rd, and 95th Regiments, a numerous force of native
cavalry and infantry, a siege-train of 18 heavy guns and mortars,
also 3 troops and batteries of horse and foot artillery of the Hon.
Company’s service&mdash;about 4500 of all arms. The force encamped on the
22nd March before the city, on the opposite bank of the River Chumbul;
the regiment furnished the usual working parties, trench and battery
guards, outlying picquets, etc., until the 25th of the month, when,
the capture by the enemy of the Rajah’s palace, which was held by
our troops, being imminent, 200 men of the detachment of H.M.’s 83rd
Regiment, with the 1st Brigade, were directed to cross the river, with
other troops, for its protection; this detachment sustained a loss of
3 men killed and 5 non-commissioned officers and men wounded in the
following three days, in which some vigorous assaults by the enemy were
repulsed with heavy loss in killed and wounded. On the 30th the city
was taken, having been entered by three columns of assault, the centre
column being led by the head-quarters division of the 83rd Regiment,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Steele; the detachment of the 83rd with the
1st Brigade, commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Heatly, was in
reserve, and entered the city later in the day. The regiment sustained
a loss of 1 man killed and 6 wounded. The enemy abandoned their
defences and retired towards Gwalior, having sustained a considerable
loss in the siege and assault; about 80 guns were taken in the city,
with large magazines of ammunition and supplies.</p>

<p>Having remained encamped before Kotah till the 18th April, the
besieging force was broken up, and the regiment marched on return to
Nusseerabad, arriving there on the 29th. The usual relief of detachment
of one company in the fort of Ajmere took place on the 3rd May.</p>

<p>Enfield rifles were issued to the regiment at this time; the
waist-belt, with small pouch in front, had been supplied to the
regiment in supersession of the old cross-belts about one year
previously.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Kelsall having retired on full pay, Major Steele
succeeded to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment on the 13th
April, 1858.</p>

<p>On the 23rd May, the two companies which had been on detachment at
Neemuch, under command of Major Austen, since December, rejoined the
head-quarters of the regiment.</p>

<p>About the middle of June, the decisive successes of the division of
the army commanded by Major-General H. Rose having caused the rebel
army to evacuate the Gwalior territory, a very numerous hostile force,
estimated at 10,000 men, crossed the River Chumbul, and entered the
territory of the Rajah of Jeypoor, who had always displayed friendly
feelings towards the British Government. A considerable force, about
2500 strong, of which the head-quarters and 600 of the 83rd composed
a part, was placed under orders for field service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> in consequence,
and marched from Nusseerabad on the 28th June, under command of
Major-General Roberts. On the 3rd July this force arrived within
one march of the city of Jeypoor, which was in imminent danger from
the advance of the rebel army. On the approach of General Roberts’s
division, the enemy, changing their direction, moved southwards and
attacked the capital of the Rajah of Tonk, which was occupied and
partially plundered by them. The Rajah retired to his fortified palace,
and offered all the resistance in his power to their assaults. A
portion of his troops, however, proved faithless, and joined the enemy,
giving up to them the guns which had been in their charge.</p>

<p>General Roberts’s advance by forced marches caused the rebels to retire
from before Tonk, and a considerable portion of the British force was
detached in pursuit in a south-easterly direction; about 900 men,
including the 83rd Regiment, remaining under the personal command
of the general. The weather was at this time extremely hot, and the
exposure consequent on the urgent duties in which the force was engaged
proved fatal to many of the soldiers composing it. Six men of the 83rd
died from sunstroke between the 7th and 10th July.</p>

<p>The enemy, pressed upon by the detached column, changed their line of
march towards the west, and General Roberts, still moving by forced
marches, succeeded in coming up with them late on the evening of the
8th August. They were seen formed in great force near the village of
Sanganeer&mdash;the number was estimated at 8000 men, two-thirds of whom
were cavalry. The regiment at once advanced to the attack under a heavy
fire from the artillery of the enemy, which, however, being directed
too high, did no execution, while many of the rebels were killed and
wounded by the rifles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> the 83rd. Darkness, however, coming on,
enabled the enemy to retire and withdraw the whole of their guns. The
force had marched this day thirty miles, and bivouacked on the spot,
having far outmarched their tents and baggage. Waiting one day to allow
the column which had been detached from Tonk to join him, General
Roberts’s force moved on the 10th August in pursuit of the enemy. This
brigade had been reinforced by the junction of one troop of Bombay
Horse Artillery, a squadron of the 8th Royal Irish Hussars, a squadron
of Native Light Cavalry, 4 companies 72nd Highlanders, and a Sepoy
Regiment of the Bombay army, as well as by a strong body of Belooch
horsemen.</p>

<p>A very persevering pursuit now took place on the track of the rebel
army, the outpost picquets of which were surprised and cut to pieces on
more than one occasion. At about 7 a.m. on the 14th August, the enemy
were seen moving in heavy masses, of horse and foot, on the further
bank of the Bunnass River, their line of movement being covered by
their artillery, which was posted in a battery on the crest of a rising
ground close to the village of Kottaria; only waiting to form and load,
the force at once advanced towards the river, the 83rd Regiment leading
in a double column of sub-divisions from its centre. The enemy’s guns
opened with round and grape, and were instantly vigorously engaged by
the British Horse Artillery, and the fire on both sides was for a time
extremely heavy. The 83rd, forming line, crossed the river, meeting but
little resistance, and the enemy, abandoning their guns, retired with
precipitation. The cavalry charged amongst the retreating artillerymen
and infantry, and the pursuit was continued for some miles, very great
numbers of the rebels falling under their sabres, while the fugitives
seeking shelter in the groves and copse-wood were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> destroyed by our
infantry. In the evening the force returned and encamped near Kottaria,
having sustained only the small loss of 22 killed and wounded, while
fully 1000 of the rebels were left dead on the field, and 4 guns, with
their ammunition, and many elephants and camels laden with stores,
were captured. The enemy’s flight did not cease till they had crossed
the Chumbul and entirely evacuated Rajpootana. The force returned
northwards by easy marches, and the regiment reoccupied its former
quarters in the camp at Nusseerabad on the 29th of August.</p>

<p>On the 4th October the first half-yearly inspection of the regiment
which had taken place since April, 1857, was made by Major-General
Roberts, commanding Rajpootana Field Force, who was pleased to issue
a highly complimentary order to the regiment on this occasion.
Lieutenant-Colonel Steele was commanding and Lieutenant J. N. Colthurst
was adjutant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1858.</div>

<p>By order of her Majesty, published 18th August, 1858, a medal and
clasp was granted to all the troops engaged in field service in the
repression of the mutinies in India, and lists of those so entitled in
the regiment were forwarded on the 3rd and 4th November, 1858.</p>

<p>By order of the Governor-General in Council, dated 29th September,
1858, a donation of six months’ full batta was granted to all officers
and men who had served with the Rajpootana Field Force.</p>

<p>On October 26th, 1858, Colonel Botet Trydell was promoted
to major-general, and Major C. W. Austen succeeded to the
lieutenant-colonelcy in the regiment.</p>

<p>Major-General Trydell served in the 83rd for a period of fifty-four
years. He was present with the 1st Battalion at the taking of the Cape
of Good Hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> in 1806, including the battle of Blueberg; and also in
Ceylon through the Kandyan rebellion.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Steele having proceeded to England early in the
month of December, 1858, the command of the regiment devolved on
Lieutenant-Colonel Austen, the second lieutenant-colonel. On the 17th
of this month, a field force was formed at Nusseerabad under the
personal command of Brigadier Honner, commanding Rajpootana Field
Force, consisting of the head-quarters of the 83rd Regiment, 500
strong, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel C. Austen, with a troop and
a half-battery of artillery, a considerable force of cavalry of the 8th
Hussars and 1st Lancers, and the 12th Regiment N. I. The force marched
to Sanganeer on the Neemuch road, arriving there on the 21st. On the
23rd the head-quarters of the 83rd, 300 strong, with the 12th Regiment
N. I., and half a battery, were ordered back to Nusseerabad, arriving
there on the 27th. Three companies under Lieutenant-Colonel Heatly,
consisting of 200 men, remained with the brigade under Brigadier Honner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1859.</div>

<p>Early in the month of January, 1859, intelligence having been received
that the rebel force was again moving on Tonk, with the intention of
reaching Jeypoor, the head-quarters of the 83rd, with 300 men, part
of the 12th Regiment N. I., and half a battery of artillery, the
whole under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Holmes, proceeded on
the 8th in an easterly direction to Diggee, to cover the road from
Tonk to Jeypoor. Having received information that Tonk was threatened,
the force marched through Tonk to Bamboor on the 11th; here it was
discovered that the rebels had passed by, and the force accordingly
marched the following day (twenty-two miles) in a north-east route to
Jullai. Finding that the rebels had only left that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> morning, and were
encamped at Chatsoo, twenty-two miles distant, the force marched again
that night, arriving at Chatsoo before daybreak. The rebels had just
left when the brigade of Brigadier Showers&mdash;chiefly cavalry&mdash;having
come up, continued the pursuit. Colonel Holmes’s force then marched
on Jeypoor, arriving there on the 17th and leaving on the 18th, and
after four days’ severe marching through deep sand, came up with the
rebel force at “Seekur” at 4 a.m., having during the last thirty hours
accomplished a march of fifty-two miles. The moon was just setting when
our troops surprised the rebel camp, and owing to the darkness and
precipitation with which the rebels fled, together with our deficiency
of cavalry, our troops were unable to inflict any serious loss on them.
About 80 were killed, 50 taken prisoners, and many horses and camels.
The force halted at Seekur for one day, having during the previous
thirteen days marched a distance of 292 miles. After this, the force
proceeded in combination with other columns to harass the rebels, and
marched over a great part of Jeypoor and Joudpoor, arriving finally on
the 18th February at Suget on the road between Nusseerabad and Deesa.
Information having been here received that the rebels had escaped
through a pass in the hills, the force, after a halt of four days,
returned to Nusseerabad, arriving there on the 1st March.</p>

<p>The field force, under Brigadier Honner, to which were attached 200 men
of the 83rd Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Heatly, also returned on
the 1st March, having been in the field since the 14th December, during
which period they traversed 995 miles of country; and on one occasion,
in attempting to surprise the rebels, they marched forty-four miles
in twenty-four hours. In the pursuit of the rebels, terminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> in
the affair of Kosana, Brigadier Honner’s force marched 130 miles, over
tracts of deep, heavy land, in four days. The 83rd detachment in this
last pursuit, consisting of 9 sergeants, 4 corporals, 1 drummer, and
119 privates, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Heatly, with Captain
Marsh, Lieutenants Onslow and Huyshe, were mounted on camels. Their
services during the operations terminating in the defeat of the rebels
at “Koshana” are honourably mentioned in Brigadier Honner’s despatch.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1859 a letter was addressed by the Earl of Howth,
Lord-Lieutenant of the county of Dublin, to General Sir Frederick
Stovin, <span class="sm">G.C.B.</span> and <span class="sm">K.C.M.G.</span>, the colonel of the
regiment, which is subjoined:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="r1 narrow">“<span class="smcap">Howth Castle</span>, <i>July 28th, 1859</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;An application has been made to me by
Lieutenant-Colonel Steele, of the 83rd Regiment, in my capacity
of the Lord-Lieutenant of the county of Dublin, to give the
assistance of my sanction and co-operation in forwarding an
application from him as commanding officer of the 83rd Regiment,
that the distinctive appellation of the ‘County of Dublin’
Regiment may be conferred upon that corps. Lieutenant-Colonel
Steele has suggested that I should communicate with you as
the colonel of the 83rd on the subject of his wishes, and I
accordingly beg to do so. Lieutenant-Colonel Steele accompanied
his application to me by an extract from the records of the 83rd
Regiment, and it most plainly appears that the regiment was
raised in the county of Dublin in the year 1793, under a letter
of service granted to its first lieutenant-colonel commandant,
William Fitch, who was killed at the head of the regiment in the
Maroon war, in the island of Jamaica, three years afterwards.
It further appears from its records that the 83rd Regiment has
seen much active foreign service, and has been distinguished
by its discipline and valour in many parts of the world, and
recently in the suppression of the mutiny in India, where it is
at present serving.</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that
the regiment was originally raised exclusively in the county of
Dublin, I have much pleasure in expressing my concurrence in the
application made by Lieutenant-Colonel Steele on the part of his
regiment. I consider that it would be creditable to the county
of Dublin, that a regiment raised in it, and of whose services
it may be very justly proud, should be distinguished by its
name, and I give this letter to Lieutenant-Colonel Steele for
conveyance to you, in the hope that it may aid in inducing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief to recommend to her
Majesty that the title of the ‘County of Dublin’ Regiment may be
conferred on the 83rd.</p>

<p class="left30 narrow">“I have the honour, etc.,</p>

<p class="r1 narrow">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">Howth</span>.</p>

<p class="left3 narrow">Colonel 83rd Regiment.”</p></div>


<p>This application was brought to the notice of his Royal Highness the
Duke of Cambridge, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, by Sir F. Stovin,
and the title of the “County of Dublin” Regiment was conferred on the
83rd.</p>

<p>The following letter from the Adjutant-General reached the regiment at
Nusseerabad on the 19th December, 1859, just sixty-seven years after
the regiment had been raised in the county of Dublin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="r1 narrow">“<span class="smcap">Horse Guards, S.W.</span>, <i>October 29th, 1859</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;By desire of his Royal Highness the General
Commanding-in-Chief, I have the honour to acquaint you that
her Majesty has been graciously pleased to authorize the 83rd

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Steele, who had commanded the regiment in several
engagements in the early part of the Mutiny, had been decorated by her
Majesty with the insignia of a Companion of the Bath for his services.</p>

<p>The half-yearly inspection of the regiment was made by Brigadier Adams,
<span class="sm">C.B.</span>, commanding the southern Mahratta division on April 25th,
1861.</p>

<p>A frock of scarlet serge, and a wicker helmet covered with grey linen,
with a turban round it, were ordered to be adopted by the regiments in
India, in supersession of the shell jacket and chaco hitherto worn, and
the regiment was provided with them accordingly about this time.</p>

<p>Intimation was received in August that the regiment was to embark for
England in the approaching cold season. On the 18th November, his
Excellency Lieutenant-General Sir William Mansfield, <span class="sm">K.C.B.</span>,
Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay presidency, having visited Belgaum
on a tour of inspection, went through the barracks of the regiment,
and afterwards reviewed the 83rd on a brigade field-day, at the
conclusion of which he was pleased to make a speech to the regiment,
in which he expressed his approbation of the state of the corps in the
strongest terms; his Excellency used the words that “he never in the
course of his service had seen a regiment in higher order, and that
he should not fail to report accordingly to his Royal Highness the
Commander-in-Chief.”</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards the regiment was permitted by general order to
give volunteers for further service in India to every regiment serving
there, and a number of non-commissioned officers and men, as per
margin,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> having volunteered to other regiments, were struck off the
strength of the 83rd from the 19th December, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1862.</div>

<p>The regiment commenced its march to the coast on the 22nd January,
1862, and reached Vingorla on the 29th of that month, where they were
encamped till the 5th of February, on which day the regiment, under
command of Lieutenant-Colonel Steele, <span class="sm">C.B.</span>, embarked in the
hired transport <i>King Lear</i>; the ship sailed the same evening for
Plymouth.</p>

for Gravesend, where the regiment disembarked on the 21st May, 1862,
and proceeded to Dover on the same day by rail, and was quartered in
the citadel.</p>

regiment on the 29th July, after a service of twenty-eight years in the
83rd. He died in London on the 6th August, only eight days after he had
been gazetted out.</p>

<p>Major A. Barnard Hankey succeeded to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the
regiment.</p>

<p>In August the regiment was reviewed by Lieutenant-General Viscount
Melville, <span class="sm">K.C.B.</span>, who commanded it for several years in Canada
and England.</p>

<p>Several drafts of recruits, both officers and men, joined head-quarters
from the depôt at Chatham, and brought up the strength of the regiment,
which had been reduced to a mere skeleton by the volunteering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> at
Belgaum, and the discharge of many men on its arrival at Dover.</p>

<p>In October the regiment was inspected on the Castle Hill parade
ground by H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge, Commander-in-Chief, who, in a
complimentary speech, expressed his approval of its appearance, and of
the rapid manner in which the regiment had been brought forward since
its arrival in England.</p>

<p>In October a large number of the men were sent up to see the Great
Exhibition of 1862 by the officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1863.</div>

<p>The 83rd remained quartered at Dover until the 23rd April, when
it marched to the camp at Shorncliffe, where it relieved the 69th
Regiment, which had been sent to the Cape, and was quartered in C lines.</p>

<p>In May the regiment was inspected by Brigadier-General Sutton,
